  //his chapter covers the core of the d3 algorithm. For your prep create a page to explain how some of the pieces work. In particular, explain what the select, append, text,style commands do. People wishing to do more should demonstrate the full effect by using d3 to generate some html (doesn't have to be very complex).

        The <q>d3</q> is an object that is defined by the varying methods of usage. For this prep, we were assigned to talk about the different methods used for d3, which are <i>select, append, text, and style</i>. Each of these methods builds off of one another like a chain (as explained in the chapter) and are used to grab specific elements within its domain. In short, each consecutive command hands off to the next. The <i>select</i> method is used to select the first element in the DOM that matches what you are trying to get. The <i>append</i> method is used to get what is inside of the <i>selected</i> element. The <i>text</i> command takes a string and places it within the appended item, like I stated before, each of these commands hands off to the next. Finally the <i>style</i> command changes the color of the text, you can even specify which part of the text you want to be changed within Javascript.
